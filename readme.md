- **Riding Style Match** (30 points): Direct and cross-compatibility scoring
- **Experience Level** (25 points): Engine size appropriate for skill level  
- **Body Type Compatibility** (20 points): Ergonomic considerations
- **Engine Power** (15 points): Power-to-experience matching
- **Height Considerations** (10 points): Comfort and reach factors

### Clothing Recommendations (100-point scale):
- **Style Compatibility** (40 points): Riding style to clothing style matching
- **Fit Matching** (35 points): Body type to clothing fit correlation
- **Size Optimization** (25 points): Height/weight to sizing logic
